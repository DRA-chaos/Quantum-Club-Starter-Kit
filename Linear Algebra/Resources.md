# Resources to Learn Linear Algebra for Quantum Computing

You must be wondering, why should this be a separate section when the Qiskit textbook provides all the necessary resources to learn linear algebra. This list is more of an enrichment for someone who wants to delve deeper into Linear Algebra that is often required in theoreatical aspects of Quantum Computing, like Information science for example. Various assignments and activities provided in the links below can be solved as a group or can be a part of a study group under a Quantum Club!

Here are a few resources to learn Linear Algebra for Quantum Computing:

1. **"Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists"** by Noson S. Yanofsky and Mirco A. Mannucci: This book provides an introduction to quantum computing from a computer science perspective and covers the necessary linear algebra concepts. [Link](https://www.cambridge.org/9780521879965)

2. **"Quantum Computation and Quantum Information"** by Michael A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang: This comprehensive textbook covers various aspects of quantum computing and includes a chapter on linear algebra. [Link](https://www.cambridge.org/9781107002173)

3. **"Linear Algebra Done Right"** by Sheldon Axler: This book offers a rigorous and intuitive introduction to linear algebra, which is crucial for understanding quantum systems. [Link](https://linear.axler.net/)

4. **"Quantum Computing: A Gentle Introduction"** by Eleanor Rieffel and Wolfgang Polak: This book provides a gentle introduction to quantum computing and covers the necessary linear algebra concepts. [Link](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-Introduction-Eleanor-Rieffel/dp/0262015064)

5. **MIT OpenCourseWare - Linear Algebra** (Course): MIT offers a free online course on linear algebra, which provides a solid foundation for understanding the mathematical aspects of quantum computing. [Link](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/)

6. **Khan Academy - Linear Algebra** (Online Tutorial): Khan Academy provides a comprehensive set of tutorials on linear algebra, including topics relevant to quantum computing. [Link](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)

These resources cover fundamental linear algebra concepts and their application in the context of quantum computing. It's recommended to start with the basics and gradually progress to more advanced topics specific to quantum mechanics and quantum computing.
