# Podcasts on Quantum Computing

Sometimes, podcasts are a really innovative way to learn a concept intuitively or in a frolic manner. You could be driving or eating or maybe in the gym, try listening to any of these. Some [studies](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_stories_change_brain) show that listening to stories (or similarly, podcasts) stimulates the important parts of the brain. As a result, they help increase levels of empathy, foster relationships, and boost compassion. 
This is a curated list of podcasts that cover various aspects of quantum computing, providing insights, interviews, and discussions on the latest advancements in the field.
