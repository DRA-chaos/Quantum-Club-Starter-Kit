7. **The Great Egg Drop**: Teams are provided with raw eggs and various materials (newspaper, straws, tape) to construct a contraption that will protect the egg from breaking when dropped from a height. [Learn more](https://www.icebreakers.ws/team-building/great-egg-drop.html)

8. **Would You Rather**: Participants take turns asking each other "Would you rather" questions, presenting two scenarios, and the person has to choose their preference. It sparks interesting conversations and reveals preferences within the group. [Learn more](https://www.icebreakers.ws/small-group/would-you-rather.html)

9. **Group Drawing**: Each person adds one element to a drawing. The first person starts with a simple shape, and each subsequent person adds to the drawing until it is complete. The final result is often amusing and creative. [Learn more](https://www.icebreakers.ws/small-group/group-drawing.html)

10. **Line Up**: Participants form a line based on specific criteria (e.g., height, birthday month, shoe size) without talking. It requires communication and teamwork to organize themselves correctly. [Learn more](https://www.icebreakers.ws/team-building/line-up.html)
