## How to create a Quantum Computing Club ?

Quantum Computing has started gaining traction very fast, particularly in this decade that has witnessed several monumental discovereies in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Health and innovation etc.

Science is not science until it is communicated, and that is the very essence of starting a club, a conglomeration of a group of enthusiasts willing to explore and help others explore too! This article tries to compile various resources and events to put in place so as to make a 'Quantum Club'

While starting a club, it's always a good idea to start with foundations of a topic that the club caters to. Quantum Computing is an interdisciplinary field that often involves concepts from Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, Electronics and sometimes even chemistry and material sciences. 
Qiskit offers several libraries, packages and modules to explore many of these aspects. The following is a list of resources that can help one get started with Quantum programming using Qiskit :

Discussion with Astri
1. WHo are the people ? Workplace, colleges, different categories of people. It would be different for each of them, but a broad overview too.
2. In workplace and in college, separate these two. 
3. Website - quantum computing clubs can be facilitated to register.- meet Fabio who had made a similar website.
4. Support for hackathons and summer schools. 
5. Report of sorts every three - four months.
6. New courses, beginner courses.Wiskit events like summer schools, summer, spring, winter challenges. 

Why do we need a colub ? Why is it better than self learn ( similar to having play buddies, research on if you have people around you, you get more motivated to do this regularly.


What are some activities one can undertake to sustain and run a QUatum computing club?
 It's always very insightful to start off with the history or etymology of something. While it is true that Quantum Computing has gained a lot of traction in the recent decade, its outset dates back to the very start of civilization!


















*Activities : games, ice breakers, online and offline activities
* sample meeting agendas : start from the history of Qc
* Add internships, events and openings




Since times immemorial, club based discussions have always ignited curiosity and fuelled promethean creativity be it in labs like Bell Laboratories or at CERN that have fuelled so many new discoveries or  during wars like the French and Bolshevik revolution or during the Charist and Suffragate movements. Clubs have helped mankind understand the importance of creativity that often dawns , divison of labour and the importance of organisational accumen.

Imagine forming a conglomeration of like minded individuals who are as enthusiastic and inquisitive about you to learn, understand and grow, wouldn't having a club be an amazing avenue to bolster your journey through the quantum tunnel!

Before anything, let's dive a bit into the history and evolution of Quantum Computing. In case you're wondering that this is a very new realm, well no!
Anyone reading this for example might be the owner of a tablet or a phone or a computer, well guess what, none of these devices would have even been fabricated had it not been for the Principles of Quantum Mechanics, oh yes not to forget the advent of your favourite Netflix, Alexa or even VR wouldn't have been possible without Quantum Mechanics!

At the onset of the 20th century, scientists possessed a confident grasp of the fundamental principles governing the natural world. Building upon the foundations of eminent scientists like Newton and Galileo, they were moving towards unraveling a comprehensive understanding of motion by studying the intricate interplay between variables such as force, mass, and acceleration. This helped them obtain a broader overview of the various forces in our universe.

However, certain physical phenomena defied explanation within the framework of classical physics. One such enigma, known as the black body problem, captivated the attention of researchers towards the conclusion of the 19th century. This conundrum pertained to the description of radiation emitted by celestial bodies like stars and galaxies, which stubbornly resisted fitting into the established laws of classical physics. 

In their pursuit to unravel this perplexing phenomenon, scientists gradually arrived at the realization that classical physics was insufficient to account for the entirety of physical behavior. It was in 1901 that Max Planck achieved a breakthrough in solving the black body problem. Yet, his solution necessitated embracing a paradigm shift: he postulated that energy was quantized, existing in discrete units referred to as "quanta." This departure from classical physics proved essential in resolving the conundrum at hand. That's when the spanner was fitting in a new screw into the chamber, yes, you heard it right, that screw was directed at a different realm, the realm yet to be labelled as Quantum Physics! That's when the likes of Einstein, Bohr, Schr√∂dinger, Heisenberg and many more, confirmed this notion of the quantum of energy, giving birth to quantum mechanics. 

This can be a really good starting point to discuss in a club meeting; the history of the first quantum revolution. This is in a way analogous to reading the first few chapters of a book that give you perspectives into the fundamental principles that one would need to know to go ahead with a course. Not just would such a discussion expose you to concepts like the notion of a Wavefunction or Heisenberg's Uncertaininty Principle or even Probability theory, but this would make learning more fructuous and frolic!

Here are some resources that can help one familiarize themselves with the history of the first quantum revolution!

Additionally, you can also check out the timeline of this revolution through its ![Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics) page

But, what's most important before starting any form of discussion is to know the crew of the ship! Indeed, an ice breaker session would be a lovely way to exchange a plethora of ideas ranging from perhaps what you like to eat to where you met your best friend!
In case you're an introvert heading a club in it's first ever ice breaker session, here are a few points that can help one get started:
* Introduction : Each one can take rounds introducing a little bit about themselves; what they like to eat, where they come from, where have they studied etc.
* Games : Playing pictionary or hang-man or any such game would be a nice way to involve everyone on the team!
* Food : Everyone on the team can get a few sweets or eatables and exchange/disribute it amongst themselves, wouldn't that be a very vibrant and exuberant way to sync!


 ## Calendars and timelines
 It's great to find a way to sync frequently. Initially it might be good to organize meet-ups more frequenty ( for ex , twice or thrice a month) until the process is streamlined. There are many apps one can checkout to schedule meetings at a time that incorporates and adjusts with everyone's schedule like [Doodle](https://doodle.com/) , [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) etc. Documenting ideas on a common canvas during a meeting is very important to track each one's progress. It could range from sharing a simple Google Doc to using several e-canvases like [Mural](https://www.mural.co/) , [Conceptboard](https://conceptboard.com/) , [Miro](https://miro.com/) to name a few. This will also help someone who misses the meeting to keep up with the discussions that might take place.
