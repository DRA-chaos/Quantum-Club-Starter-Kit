## How to create a Quantum Computing Club ?

Quantum Computing has started gaining traction very fast, particularly in this decade that has witnessed several monumental discovereies in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Health and innovation etc.

Science is not science until it is communicated, and that is the very essence of starting a club, a conglomeration of a group of enthusiasts willing to explore and help others explore too! This article tries to compile various resources and events to put in place so as to make a 'Quantum Club'

While starting a club, it's always a good idea to start with foundations of a topic that the club caters to. Quantum Computing is an interdisciplinary field that often involves concepts from Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, Electronics and sometimes even chemistry and material sciences. 
Qiskit offers several libraries, packages and modules to explore many of these aspects. The following is a list of resources that can help one get started with Quantum programming using Qiskit :

* Qiskit Documentation: The official Qiskit documentation is a comprehensive resource that provides tutorials, guides, and API documentation. It covers everything from installing Qiskit to running quantum circuits and experiments. You can find it at: https://qiskit.org/documentation/

* Qiskit Textbook: "Learn Quantum Computing using Qiskit" is an interactive textbook that introduces the principles of quantum computing and quantum programming using Qiskit. It provides explanations, examples, and hands-on exercises to help you grasp the concepts effectively. You can access it online for free at: https://qiskit.org/textbook/

* Qiskit YouTube Channel: The Qiskit YouTube channel offers a wealth of video tutorials, workshops, and talks by experts in the field. It covers various topics related to quantum programming, including getting started with Qiskit, quantum algorithms, and quantum machine learning. You can find the channel at: https://www.youtube.com/c/Qiskit/

* Qiskit Global Summer School: Qiskit organizes an annual Global Summer School that provides intensive training on quantum computing and programming with Qiskit. The sessions are led by experts and cover a wide range of topics. You can check for upcoming events and access previous recordings on their website.

* Qiskit Community: Join the Qiskit community to connect with other quantum enthusiasts, ask questions, and learn from experienced users. The community forum is a great place to seek guidance, share ideas, and find solutions to common challenges. You can access the forum at: https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/qiskit

* Qiskit GitHub Repository: Qiskit is an open-source framework, and its GitHub repository is a valuable resource for accessing the source code, examples, and community-contributed projects. You can explore the repository at: https://github.com/Qiskit

* Qiskit Slack Channel: The Qiskit Slack workspace provides a platform for real-time discussions and interactions with the Qiskit team and the community. It's an excellent place to ask questions, seek advice, and engage with fellow quantum programmers. You can join the workspace at: https://qiskit.slack.com/


Discussion with Astri
1. WHo are the people ? Workplace, colleges, different categories of people. It would be different for each of them, but a broad overview too.
2. In workplace and in college, separate these two. 
3. Website - quantum computing clubs can be facilitated to register.- meet Fabio who had made a similar website.
4. Support for hackathons and summer schools. 
5. Report of sorts every three - four months.
6. New courses, beginner courses.Wiskit events like summer schools, summer, spring, winter challenges. 

Why do we need a colub ? Why is it better than self learn ( similar to having play buddies, research on if you have people around you, you get more motivated to do this regularly.


What are some activities one can undertake to sustain and run a QUatum computing club?
 It's always very insightful to start off with the history or etymology of something. While it is true that Quantum Computing has gained a lot of traction in the recent decade, its outset dates back to the very start of civilization!


















*Activities : games, ice breakers, online and offline activities
* sample meeting agendas : start from the history of Qc
* Add internships, events and openings
