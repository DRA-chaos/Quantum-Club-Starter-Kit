# Student Congress/Symposium Organizer's Guide

This README provides a guide on organizing a successful student congress or symposium. A student science or symposium can be a good avenue to network with like minded individuals in the same field. This differs from a hackathon in that it involves individuals not just into coding or theory but experiments as well. Participants can also exhibit posters or deliver short presentations on Quantum related topics or projects they have worked on.
